    <p>
      Noqui is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based
      dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions,
      olives, pineapple, meat, etc.) baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is
      sometimes called a pizzetta.
